    <td>I went through my old repl.it projects and I looked through of my previous knowledge and looking at it gave my brain a recap and it all came back to me. To create my quiz I had multiple else if clauses. I enabled it so that my answer and score was set to 0 and every time you get a question right your score changes but the answer remains 1 this meant that when you got a question right it added 1 to your score.</td>
