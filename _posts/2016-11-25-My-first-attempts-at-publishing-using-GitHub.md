    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Mainly by focused listening and watching a demonstration. And also I looked at the teachers code on the board and implemented it in mine.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The first set of instructions didn't go so well as I couldn't create a user name which then left me behind on the other things. As I was getting more and more left behind I listened to the teacher so I didn't miss any more instructions and caught up quickly on the bits before.

I should make notes so if I do get left behind I can follow a set of instructions on my notes to catch up.</td>
